This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a business, an essential task for reducing customer attrition and increasing customer retention. We have explored different machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 0.79.

## Introduction

Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company, can have a significant impact on a business's profitability. Predicting customer churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features

The dataset used in this project includes various features, such as:

- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender)
- Subscription details (e.g., contract type)
- Usage information (e.g., monthly charges, data usage)
- Customer feedback and satisfaction

These features are used to predict the likelihood of customer churn.

## Models

We have experimented with three different machine learning models:

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** ANNs are powerful deep learning models that can capture complex relationships in the data. We have trained ANNs to predict customer churn.

2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is a simple yet effective model for classification tasks. We have used KNN to predict customer churn based on the nearest neighbors in feature space.

3. **Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to predict customer churn. It is known for its flexibility and performance.

## Best Model

Surprisingly, all three models—ANN, KNN, and Random Forest—yielded the same accuracy of 0.79 when predicting customer churn. This means that all three models are equally effective at identifying potential churners.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6+
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for ANN)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running notebooks)
- Additional libraries as needed for data preprocessing and model evaluation

You can install these dependencies using `pip` with the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

To predict customer churn using any of the models:

1. Ensure you have the required dataset and data preprocessing in place.
2. Train the chosen model with your data, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
3. Use the trained model to predict customer churn.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.

Feel free to explore other models, fine-tune hyperparameters, or experiment with feature engineering to further improve prediction accuracy.
